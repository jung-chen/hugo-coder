I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Political Science](https://polisci.ucmerced.edu) at the [University of California, Merced.](https://www.ucmerced.edu) My research focuses on how individual-level predispositions shape political attitudes and strategic behaviors in American and comparative contexts, with a specific interest in the effects of bio-psychological factors. I'm currently studying topics on political polarization, dehumanization, and the physiological basis of intergroup attitudes. My dissertation concerns why partisans develop extreme partisanship and dehumanizing perception in the United States, and how these attributes affect their subjective well-being that motivates them to become political hobbyists.

I am a Taiwanese.

I received my M.A. in Political Science from UC Merced, and my B.A. in Political Science and B.S. in Psychology from [National Cheng Kung University](http://web.ncku.edu.tw/bin/home.php)
